# Matlab-Parallel-Video-Processor

This is a premade MATLAB script that lets you edit a videos frames using MATLAB, and then save it along with its Audio.
You will need FFMPEG or another tool to compress the output afterwards.

Currently this has only been tested for Windows, some modification would be needed to run on Linux due to the way MATLAB computer vision is handled.
